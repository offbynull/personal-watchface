Provides the following features...

1. **Displays 20 newest Ars Technica headlines**. Queries for the newest articles each time the watchface is active. Tap on the current headline to view the next headline.
1. **Continuous heart rate monitoring**. So long as the screen is on, this watchface will measure your heartrate. The watchface will also vibrate and change the background color once your heart rate reaches certain thresholds. Note that it takes 10 to 30 seconds for the S2 to pick up a pulse.
1. **Ability to keep the screen on indefinitely**. Useful for when you want to stop the watch from going to sleep so that you can measure your heart rate for a prolonged period of time. Note that this will cause the battery to drain much quicker than normal.
1. **Ability to switch to a timer**. One-touch press to quickly switch between a timer and the current time.
